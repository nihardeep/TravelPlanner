Objective
The goal of this travel planner is to provide users with a seamless, AI-powered way to build personalized travel itineraries — from accommodation to activities — with minimal manual effort. By simply entering their preferences (destination, travel style, number of people, etc.), the planner generates a complete and structured travel plan.

The intent is to make trip planning fast, flexible, and tailored to individual needs — whether the user wants a relaxing holiday, an adventure-packed getaway, or a cultural journey.

This system helps both leisure and frequent travellers reduce planning stress, save time, and receive recommendations that genuinely match their interests and preferences.
